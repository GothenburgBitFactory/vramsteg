Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Please follow the instructions below to build vramsteg with cmake.


Pre-requisites
--------------

You will need the CMake build system installed in order to build vramsteg
from source.

More information on cmake can be obtained at http://cmake.org


Basic Installation
------------------

Briefly, these shell commands will unpack, build and install vramsteg:

  $ tar xzf vramsteg-X.Y.Z.tar.gz                     [1]
  $ cd vramsteg-X.Y.Z                                 [2]
  $ cmake .                                           [3]
  $ make                                              [4]
  $ sudo make install                                 [5]
  $ cd .. ; rm -r vramsteg-X.Y.Z                      [6]

These commands are explained below:

  1. Unpacks the source tarball. This creates the directory vramsteg-X.Y.Z,
     containing all the code.

  2. Change directory to the root of the distribution.

  3. Invokes CMake to scan for dependencies and machine-specific details, then
     generate the makefiles. This may take a minute.

  4. Builds vramsteg. This may take a minute.

  5. Installs the program, documentation and other data files.

  6. Removes the temporary directory.


Build and configurations options
--------------------------------

You can customize the configuration run with cmake variables. This will modify
the installation process:

To change the installation directory you use the following configuration
variable:

  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path-to-installation-dir> .

cmake configuration variables are applied with the -D option and consist of a
<name> and a <value>:

  $ cmake -D<name>=<value> .
