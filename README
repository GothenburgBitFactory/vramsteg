Vramsteg ('progress' in Svenska, almost)

Vramsteg is an open source, command line utility that provides shell scripts
with a full-featured progress indicator.  The progress bar can display elapsed
time, remaining time estimate, percentage completed, and labels.  The progress
bar can have user-specified colors, and be rendered in multiple styles.

See the man page (enter 'man vramsteg') for full details on how to use vramsteg
or look in the srv/examples directory for several shell scripts that illustrate
usage.
